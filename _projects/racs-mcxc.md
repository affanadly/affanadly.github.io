Galactic clusters and their environments are usually observed and investigated in X-ray, and one of such results is the MCXC catalogue {% cite Piffaretti2011 %}. However, the radio emission from the galaxies in these clusters is not well understood. The RACS-low catalogue {% cite Hale2021 %} is a radio survey of the southern sky using the Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder (ASKAP), and it provides a unique opportunity to study the radio galaxies in these regions. I worked on the cluster matching, source count calculations, and population tests.
