Phantom Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) are a class of FRBs that are not of astrophysical origin, but are instead (potentially) caused by instrumental effects in the Five-hundred-meter Aperature Spherical Telescope (FAST) data. I researched on the correlation of phantom FRBs with coloured noise i.e. noise with a non-zero power spectrum.
