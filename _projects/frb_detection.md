Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) are brief, bright flashes of radio waves that last only a few milliseconds of extragalactic origin. I researched on developing and improving FRB detection codes, and wrote a standablone Python FRB detection program named the Python Language Radio Burst Emission Automatic Roger (PoLaR BEAR) based on a precursor program written in C++.
