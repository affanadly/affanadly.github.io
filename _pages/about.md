I am a Ph.D. student at the [Radio Cosmology Research Laboratory](https://sites.google.com/view/radiocosmologylaboratory/home), Universiti Malaya, Malaysia. My research interest lies in various fields of astronomy and astrophysics, including high-mass star formation, high-redshift radio galaxies (HzRGs), galaxy clusters and filaments, fast radio bursts (FRBs), gravitational lensing, and radio frequency interference (RFI).
